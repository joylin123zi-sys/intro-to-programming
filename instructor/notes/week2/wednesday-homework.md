# Before 5:00 pm ET today

Send me an email that takes three "concepts" we have covered this week or last week and tell me how you would describe them in your own words. 

Make this SHORT. I don't need a book.

This back. For example:

- What is a Unit Test?
- What is an HTTP API?
- What is routing in an API?
- What is an Interface in C#? Why would we use one?
- What is a "pipeline" - what are those for.
