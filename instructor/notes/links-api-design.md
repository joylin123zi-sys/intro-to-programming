# Links App

We are going to have a frontend app that allows users to add links to interesting articles, videos and resources.

This week we'll be building the API portion.

## Resources

### "links"

- Get a list of all the links
    - GET http://localhost:1337/links

    - POST http://loalhost:1337/links
    
    - PUT
    - DELETE 
- Add a link
- Maybe just get a single link
- Remove a link 
    - Only the person that added the link can remove it (or a "Manager")
