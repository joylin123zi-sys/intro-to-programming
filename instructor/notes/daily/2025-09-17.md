## Today

- Good Job on your "Homework"
    - Seems like lots of testing insights.
      - Big emphasis on verification ("it works")
        - All we can test is our *understanding* of the requirements.
      - Also remember the "esoteric" part.
        - It is us intentionally slowing ourselves down.
        - So we can figure out what the heck we are building.
    - Coupling & Cohesion
- State and APIs
- Service Relationships
- Work on our "Sharing Cool Links" Feature.


## Terms/Phrases that we use but we should be careful about using in mixed company.

- "Refactoring"
    - "You want me to pay you to do work that will produce no recognizable new value?"
    - You wrote crappy code, and now I have to pay you to make it better? Why didn't you just create it correctly the first time?
    - step 3 refactor - just do it as you go.
- "Prototypes"
    - "You want me to pay you to write code that we will never put into production?"
    - "proto" - "before", "type" - thing (click keys on your keyboard)
