# The Practice

"Code Kata" - 

1. It isn't about "finishing" or "doing it right".
2. Do it OVER AND OVER AGAIN
3. Simulate the REAL WORLD
    - Changing Requirements
    - Fake it like you don't know what's next.
        - For every requirement, write the simplest thing possible that would work to make that test pass.
            - Try not to anticipate (or remember) what is coming next.
            - Practice "Quiet Quitting" - stick to the requirements.
            - BAD CODE IS BETTER THAN NO CODE.
            - Learn to not be stuck for too long before you ask for help.
