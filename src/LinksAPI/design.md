# Our Links API

## Adding a Link

- Define the Resource
- Select the proper method (GET POST PUT DELETE)
- Define our "representation" - how we are going to pass data from the client to the server, and how the server is going to send us data.

```http
POST http://localhost:1337/links
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: bearer 39378973973973

{
  "href": "https://allstate.com",
  "description": "Good insurance. Great Developers"
}
```

```http
GET http://localhost:1337/links/c9a772d9-b947-4756-b3ae-62b658b1a041
```
